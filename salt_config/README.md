# INAP Agile Salt Config

Inlcuded is a skeleton config for congirufing Saltstack to work with [Agile](http://www.internap.com/cloud/public-cloud/) as Salt Cloud Provider.

Agile is built using an OpenStack implementation that adheres very closely to the intended specifications and hence will likely be able to support any OpenStack feature functionality provided by [Apache Libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org/), which is part of the [SaltStack Libcloud](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/cloud/install/index.html) project.

When in doubt please see SaltStack's documentation for [OpenStack and Salt](https://github.com/openstack/openstack-salt)


Follows configuration syntax for Salt `2016.3.1`
